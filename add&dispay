/*
6. Write a java program to do-while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers.
 The numbers should be added and the sum displayed.
 The loop should ask the user whether he or she wishes to perform the operation again.
 If so, the loop should repeat; otherwise it should terminate.

Sample Output:
Enter the first number: 3
Enter the second number: 15
Sum of numbers: 18
Do you want to continue y/n? y
Enter the first number: 12
Enter the second number: 10
Sum of numbers: 22
 Do you want to continue y/n? n
